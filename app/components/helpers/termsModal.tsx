loss of actual or anticipated profit; 
losses caused by business interruption; 
loss of goodwill or reputation; or

DECLARATION AND WARRANTY
The Buyer hereby declares and warrants that it is a juristic person whose asset value or annual turnover (calculated in accordance with the prevailing method of calculation prescribed pursuant to the provisions of section 6 of the Consumer Protection Act, No. 68 of 2008), at the time that it enters into this Agreement, equals or exceeds R2 000 000,00 (two million Rand) which is the prevailing threshold value determined by the Minister in terms of the said section 6.
FORCE MAJEURE 
Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall be responsible for any failure to fulfil their respective obligations under this Agreement (other than the payment of money) if fulfilment has been delayed, hindered, interfered with, curtailed or prevented by: 
any circumstances whatsoever which are not within the reasonable control of the Seller or of the Seller’s Suppliers or of the Buyer as the case may be; or 
any curtailment, failure or cessation of the supplies of the Fuels from any of the Seller’s or the Seller’s Suppliers’ sources of supply (whether in fact sources of supply for the purposes of the Fuel Sale Agreement or not); or
any compliance with any order, demand or request of any international, national, port, transportation, local or other authority or agency or of any body or person purporting to be or to act for such authority or agency; or 
any strike, lock-out or labour dispute (whether or not the Seller, the Seller’s Suppliers or the Buyer as the case may be are party to the same or would be able to influence or procure the settlement of the same). 
If by reason of any of the causes referred to in clause ‎7.1 either the availability from any of the Seller’s or the Seller’s Suppliers’ sources of supply of the Fuels or the normal means of transport of such Fuels is delayed, hindered, interfered with, curtailed, or prevented, the Seller shall be at liberty either to:
withhold, reduce or suspend deliveries under the Fuel Sale Agreement to such extent as the Seller may in its absolute discretion think fit in which case the Seller shall not be bound to purchase or otherwise make good shortages resulting from any such cause, although the Seller will endeavour to arrange an equitable distribution of supplies which continue to be normally available in the events referred to above; or 
offer the Buyer a restated price for supplies of the Fuels for deliveries with effect from the date (whether or not before the date of such restatement) on which the circumstances specified in clause ‎7.1 affected the deliveries concerned. If within 10 days of such notice the Buyer does not accept any restated price then the Seller may immediately terminate deliveries to the Buyer’s premises but any such restated price shall, notwithstanding any failure to agree, be payable in respect of any Fuel delivered under the Fuel Sale Agreement from the date of the Seller’s notice. 
If the circumstances which have given rise to the operation of clause ‎7.2.2 become improved or cease, thereby enabling a revision to be made in whole or in part to the Seller’s or the Seller’s Suppliers’ normal sources of supply and/or routes and means of transportation, the Seller shall give written notice of the same to the Buyer together with appropriate adjustments to the restated price. 
The performance of any obligation, whether arising out of any contract, arrangement or otherwise, by which any authority, agency, body or person is entitled to require and does require any of the Fuels by way of royalty in kind, shall be deemed to constitute a compliance with an order or request as provided in clause ‎7.1.3, notwithstanding any agreement on the part of the Seller or the Seller’s Suppliers to repurchase the same or any part of the same. 
If the Seller withholds, reduces or suspends deliveries of Fuels under the Fuel Sale Agreement pursuant to clause ‎7.2.1 the Buyer shall be free, for so long as deliveries under the Fuel Sale Agreement are withheld, suspended or reduced, to purchase from other suppliers on its own account any deficiencies in the supply of Fuels arising as a result. 
TERMINATION 
The Seller may terminate this Agreement by notice to the Buyer, without prejudice to any rights of action or claims that it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, if: 
subject to clause ‎4.1, the Buyer: 
fails to pay any invoice by its due date for payment; and/or 
commits a breach of any of the other conditions or any other term of the Fuel Sale Agreement, the effect of which breach is material, and which is either incapable of remedy, or, if capable of remedy is not remedied within 30 days of service of notice by the Seller requiring remedy, whether or not such event or breach would otherwise qualify as a repudiatory breach at common law.
